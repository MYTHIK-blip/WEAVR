# WEAVR

Modular agentic stack system for open-source tool refinement, civic-response deployment, and scroll-based container orchestration.

This system includes:
- `weavr_agent`: handles real-time stack execution, LLM bridging (via Ollama), route logic, scroll-based pipelines
- `civicstack`: supports configuration validation, system introspection, YAML processing
- Support for Ollama + local inference
- Multi-agent architecture via Docker Compose
- FastAPI across all services

Use cases: real-time civic tooling, reflexive deployments, agentic container workflows.
