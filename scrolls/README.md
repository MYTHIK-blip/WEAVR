# ðŸ§  WEAVR Agent

**WEAVR** is a standalone, scroll-driven agent that discovers, refines, glues, and weaves open-source tools into modular, civic or agentic deployment stacks.

> Not a swarm. A sovereign.

---

## ðŸŒ€ What It Does

- Scans GitHub, Hugging Face, DockerHub for mission-aligned tools
- Evaluates license, fit, and deployability
- Generates `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `.scroll` outputs
- Interfaces optionally with local LLMs (Ollama), dashboards, or civic ops
- Outputs `.zip` PORTLs for sellable or civic deployment
